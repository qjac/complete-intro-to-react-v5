### Debugging

Parcel is an ever evolving project that's just getting better. If you run into problems with it not respecting changes (particularly to your `.babelrc` or `.env` files) then delete the `dist/` and the `.cache/` directories. You can do this in bash by running from the root directoy of your project `rm -rf dist/ .cache/` or just by deleting those directories in your editor. This will force Parcel to start over and not cache anything.

See [this issue](https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v4/issues/3#issuecomment-425124265) for more specific instructions.

If you run into anything else, open an issue and we'll try to clarify or help.
